# Release Process

This document describes the release process for gwq.

## Overview

gwq uses [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) for automated releases. When a version tag is pushed, GitHub Actions automatically builds multi-platform binaries and publishes them to GitHub Releases.

## Prerequisites

- Write access to the repository
- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated

## Release Steps

### 1. Update main branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### 2. Create release branch

```bash
git checkout -b release/v0.0.X
```

### 3. Create release notes

Create a new file `docs/release-notes/v0.0.X.md` following this template:

```markdown
# Release v0.0.X

```

### 6. Create and push tag

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag v0.0.X
git push origin v0.0.X
```

### 7. Update GitHub Release notes

After GoReleaser creates the release, sync the release notes:

```bash
gh release edit v0.0.X --notes-file docs/release-notes/v0.0.X.md
```

## Automated Release Process

When a tag is pushed, the following happens automatically:

1. **build.yaml** - Runs tests and linting
2. **goreleaser.yaml** - Builds and publishes release
   - Builds binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows (amd64, arm64)
   - Creates archives (tar.gz for Unix, zip for Windows)
   - Publishes to GitHub Releases

## Version Scheme

gwq follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and documentation

Current stage: `0.0.X` (initial development)
