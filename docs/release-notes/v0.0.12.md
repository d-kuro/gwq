# Release v0.0.12

## 🎉 New Features

### TTL/Expiration Support for Worktrees (#67)

Worktrees can now have an expiration time. This helps manage temporary worktrees that are no longer needed after a certain period.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Create a worktree with a 7-day expiration
gwq add --expires 7d github.com/example/repo

# Create a worktree with a 1-hour expiration
gwq add --expires 1h github.com/example/repo

# Prune expired worktrees (dry-run)
gwq prune --expired --dry-run

# Prune expired worktrees
gwq prune --expired

# Force prune expired worktrees (skip confirmation)
gwq prune --expired --force
```

The `internal/duration` package supports flexible duration formats such as `7d`, `1h`, `30m`, etc.
