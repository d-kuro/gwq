# Release v0.0.5

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Inherit Parent Environment Variables in Exec Command (#31)
- Fixed issue where commands executed via `gwq exec` would fail with "executable file not found in $PATH"
- Commands now properly inherit the parent shell's environment variables (PATH, NODE_PATH, etc.)
- Allows tools like pnpm, npm, node to be found and executed properly in worktree directories
- Ensures seamless command execution across different worktree environments
