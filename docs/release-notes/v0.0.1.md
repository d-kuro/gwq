# Release v0.0.1

üéâ **Initial Release**

We're excited to announce the first release of gwq - a CLI tool for efficient Git worktree management with global discovery capabilities.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Experimental Release**: This is an early experimental version. Breaking changes may occur in future releases as we refine the API and features based on user feedback.

## üåü Features

### Core Functionality
- **Global Worktree Discovery**: Automatically find and manage worktrees across all repositories in your configured base directory
- **URL-Based Organization**: Prevent naming conflicts using repository URL hierarchy (e.g., `~/worktrees/github.com/user/repo/branch`)
- **Fuzzy Finder Interface**: Interactive selection with pattern matching, preview support, and multiple selection capabilities
- **AI-Powered Workflows**: Enable parallel development with multiple AI coding agents working on different features simultaneously

### Commands
- `gwq add` - Create new worktrees with automatic path generation
- `gwq list` - Display all worktrees with context-aware behavior
- `gwq get` - Retrieve worktree path for shell substitution
- `gwq exec` - Execute commands in worktree directory
- `gwq remove` - Delete worktrees with optional branch deletion
- `gwq prune` - Clean up stale worktree information
- `gwq config` - Manage configuration settings
- `gwq completion` - Generate shell completions
- `gwq version` - Display version information

### Shell Integration
- Full tab completion support for Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell
- Quick navigation with `cd $(gwq get <worktree>)`
- Execute commands without changing directory using `gwq exec`

### Configuration
Customize behavior through `~/.config/gwq/config.toml`:
- Base directory for worktrees
- Fuzzy finder preview settings
- UI preferences (colors, icons, display options)
