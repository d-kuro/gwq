# Release v0.0.6

## ✨ New Features

### Repository Settings for Per-Repository Setup (#41)

- Added `repository_settings` configuration to customize worktree creation per repository
- **File Copying**: Automatically copy files from repo root to new worktrees using `copy_files` option (supports glob patterns)
- **Setup Commands**: Run setup commands in new worktree directory using `setup_commands` option
- Errors are logged but do not abort worktree creation

Example configuration:

```toml
[[repository_settings]]
repository = "~/src/myproject"
copy_files = ["templates/.env.example"]
setup_commands = ["npm install"]
```

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Resolve Exec Command Issues with --stay and --help Options (#33)

- Fixed issue where `gwq exec --stay` commands failed to execute the specified command
- Resolved panic when using `gwq exec --help` due to nil pointer dereference
- Ensures proper command execution flow in both normal and stay modes

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### Remove Task Command (#45)

The `gwq task` command was introduced as an experimental feature for automated development task management with Claude Code. After evaluation, we decided to remove this feature to keep gwq focused on its core functionality as a git worktree manager.

- Removed `gwq task` command and all related code
- Deleted `internal/claude/` package (task management, execution engine, etc.)
- Deleted `internal/tui/` package (log viewer)
- Removed `bubbletea` dependency
- **Migration**: Users relying on `gwq task` should use alternative approaches such as shell scripts or other task management tools

## 📦 Dependency Updates

- Updated `charmbracelet/bubbletea` to v1.3.10 (#34, #36)
- Updated `spf13/cobra` to v1.10.2 (#37, #42)
- Updated `spf13/viper` to v1.21.0 (#38)
- Updated `mattn/go-runewidth` to v0.0.19 (#40)
- Bumped `go-viper/mapstructure/v2` (#35)
- Updated all dependencies to latest versions (#46)
