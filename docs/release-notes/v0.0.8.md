# Release v0.0.8

## 🎉 New Features

### Add `--stay` Flag to `gwq add` Command (#52)

Added `--stay`/`-s` flag to `gwq add` command that launches an interactive shell in the worktree directory after creation, matching the behavior of `gwq exec --stay`.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Create worktree and stay in the directory
gwq add -s feature/new-ui

# Create new branch, worktree, and stay
gwq add -b -s new-feature

# Interactive selection and stay
gwq add -i -s
```

## 🧹 Code Improvements

- Extract shared `LaunchShell()` function for code reuse between `add` and `exec` commands
- Update `Manager.Add()` and `AddFromBase()` to return worktree path for better API consistency
