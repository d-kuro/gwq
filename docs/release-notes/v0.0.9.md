# Release v0.0.9

## 🎉 New Features

### Add `gwq cd` Command (#54)

Added a new `gwq cd` command that launches a new shell session in the selected worktree directory. This provides a more intuitive alternative to `cd $(gwq get pattern)`.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Change to a worktree matching 'feature'
gwq cd feature

# Interactive selection with fuzzy finder
gwq cd

# Change to global worktree
gwq cd -g project:feature
```

**Features:**

- Launches a new shell session in the worktree directory
- Shell nesting warning when already inside a gwq-launched shell
- Type `exit` to return to the original directory
